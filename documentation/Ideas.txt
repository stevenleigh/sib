Design
==============



-git like architecture
-encrypt: commits, trees, and file blobs
-
-file blob deltas and file blob aggregate deltas (full versions)
-

Key differences from git
========================
-tree is a single file
-can have diffs of tree
-commits point to a diff of a tree





File name obfuscation
=====================
-tree is a single encrypted file containing all file names


Folder structure obfuscation
============================
-tree is a single encrypted file containing full folder names and structure
-add an amount of random data to the end of each initial commit tree (0 to 2% of extra data)


File size obfuscation
=====================
-A first commit will have one blob for each file.  That makes predicting files sizes very accurate.  Possible solution:
	-pack small files together and split large files up
-If someone transfers a movie they are typically ~700MB.  A transfer of that amount of data, regardless of number of file blobs would suggest those blobs make up a movie.
	Possible solutions:
	-enforce downloading from multiple sources
	-split up files among various storage servers
	-add an amount of random data to the end of each initial commit file (0 to 2% of extra data)
-group many files together
